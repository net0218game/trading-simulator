This repo is a web based project, in contribution with Gyork.

The basic idea is a risk free broker app. If you are new to the crypto trading stuff, you can try out crypto trading 
without the risk of losing your money. You will be buying currencies with "tokens" instead of real money (1 token = $1).

Prices are synced real time with the market, (from binance.com) so you will always be up to date when it comes to 
prices. The buy and sell mechanisms are the same as in the market too! That means you get a 100% reality based broker 
app where you don't have to worry about losing your invested money.
