    <h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer
        system</a> that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried
        around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online
        database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded
        in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in <b>digital wallets</b>.
        <br>
        Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding
        is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of
        encryption is to provide <i><u>security and safety</u></i>.
        <br>
        The first cryptocurrency was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, which was founded in
        2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the
        interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.</p>


    <h2>How does it work?</h2>


    <p>Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, that is not reliant on any central
        authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
        <br>
        Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to
        solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers,
        then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
        <br>
        If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a
        record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
        <br>
        Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are
        still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds,
        stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.</p>


    <h2>What are the top 5 cryptocurrencies?</h2>


    <div class="w3-container" style="margin: 15px; background-color: #51C4D3">
        <h4>Important!</h4>
        <p>Please note that although these are the five most popular cryptocurrencies <i>(by market cap)</i>, our
            website offers different
            currencies for trading.</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Bitcoin - BTC</h3>
            <p>As the harbinger of the cryptocurrency
                era, Bitcoin is still the coin people generally reference when
                they talk about digital currency. Its mysterious creator — allegedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> — debuted the
                currency in 2009 and it’s been on a roller-coaster ride since then. However, it wasn’t until 2017 that
                the cryptocurrency broke into popular consciousness.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Ethereum - ETH</h3>
            <p>Ethereum — the name for the cryptocurrency platform — is the second name you’re most likely to recognize
                in the crypto space. The system allows you to use ether (the currency) to perform a number of functions,
                but the smart contract aspect of Ethereum helps make it a popular currency.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Binance Coin - BNB</h3>
            <p>Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, among the largest crypto exchanges in the world.
                While originally created as a token to pay for discounted trades, Binance Coin can now be used for
                payments as well as purchasing various goods and services.</p></li>
        <li><h3>XRP - XRP</h3>
            <p>Formerly known as Ripple and created in 2012, XRP offers a way to pay in many different real-world
                currencies. Ripple can be useful in cross-border transactions and uses a trust-less mechanism to
                facilitate payments.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Terra (LUNA)</h3>
            <p>Using its currency Luna, Terra is a platform that helps backstop a range of stablecoins based on real
                currencies such as the dollar or euro. Terra helps stabilize the price of stablecoins through various
                technical means, and it also supports smart contracts.</p></li>
